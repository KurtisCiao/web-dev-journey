            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm Kurtis Ciao, a driven, disciplined, and constantly evolving individual. I move with purpose — quietly intense, sharp-minded, and grounded. I don’t chase noise, I build momentum. I’m passionate about learning and mastering new skills, especially in tech, automation, and design. Whether I’m coding a project, training in martial arts, or helping others grow their business, I always bring focus and intensity. I question everything, learn fast, and don’t stop until things make sense. I value self-discipline, growth, and doing the hard things even when no one’s watching. Confident with a playful edge, sometimes cocky, but always real. I believe in showing up better than yesterday and earning respect through action. This is just the beginning.
